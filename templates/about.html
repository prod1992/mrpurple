                            Mr. Purple, a rooftop bar and restaurant located on the 15th floor of Hotel Indigo Lower East Side, captures the vibrant and artistic spirit of the LES. Designed by internationally acclaimed design firm Crème Design, the space recreates an artist-loft ambiance with indoor and outdoor areas displayed through the use of reclaimed wood structures, juxtaposed with concrete, metal, free hanging lights, and contemporary wooden furniture. Using downtown New York as a backdrop, the 3,000 sq. ft. interior space is complemented by two terraces. The smaller 750 sq. ft. eastern terrace is perfect for an intimate gathering. The larger terrace located on the west side of the space measures 5,000 sq. ft., and is outfitted with its own swimming pool, bar and variety of seating options including chaise lounges, banquettes, and high top communal tables. Seating at the center of the terrace is defined by posts draped with a flowing canopy, providing shade for guests during daylight and transforming to a nighttime playground with festoon lighting by dusk. Mr. Purple’s menu connects with local iconic culinary staples such as Russ & Daughters, Melt Bakery, Il Laboratorio del Gelato and Beecher’s Handmade Cheese. The cocktail, beer and wine menu features an expansive collection of small-batch spirits, regionally brewed craft beers, universal wine offerings and a rotating selection of Gerber Group’s classic and modern cocktails that highlight market fresh ingredients.
